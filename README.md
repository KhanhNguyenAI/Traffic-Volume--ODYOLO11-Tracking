# ðŸš— Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking with YOLO11n

This project demonstrates how to combine **YOLO11n** for object detection with a **tracking algorithm** (e.g., SORT) to track and count objects (like vehicles) in video â€” **without using any external object counting library**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Real-time object detection using **YOLO11n**
- âœ… Object tracking using **SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking)**
- âœ… Custom line-based object counting logic
- âœ… Supports video input
- âœ… Visualizations with bounding boxes, track IDs, and counting line
- ðŸš« No use of `ObjectCounting` libraries â€” all logic is implemented manually for flexibility


## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **YOLO11n** detects objects (e.g., cars) in each frame.
2. **SORT** assigns unique IDs to each object across frames.
3. A custom **counting line** is drawn in the frame.
4. When an object crosses the line in a specific direction, the count is incremented.
5. The results (bounding boxes, tracking IDs, count) are displayed and optionally saved.
